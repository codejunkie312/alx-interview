# 0x03. Log Parsing
## Concepts Needed:
1. **File I/O in Python**:
* Understand how to read from `sys.stdin` line by line.
* [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

2. **Signal Handling in Python**:
* Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
* [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

3. **Data Processing**:
* Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
* Aggregating data to compute summaries.

4. **Regular Expressions**:
* Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
* [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

5. **Dictionaries in Python**:
* Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
* [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

5. **Exception Handling**:
* Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
* [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
